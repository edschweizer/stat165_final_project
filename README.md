# stat165_final_project

This repository has the data sources and notebook files used to reproduce the forecast in our final project. The clean_base_rates_notebook uses the .xlsx data in order to produce the final_forecast_dataset.csv. The simulation notebook then uses final_forecast_dataset.csv in order to do our final forecast.
